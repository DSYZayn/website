# Release Notes

## Versions

We adopt the Semantic Versioning of the format as v\<major\>.\<minor\>.\<build\>, e.g. v3.10.7.

## Branchs

We are maintaining three minor version branchs at any time:

* Stable: The maintenance branch. We only fix bugs, but do not add any new features. It is currently v3.9.
* Mainline: The currently released branch. we will add minor incremental features and fix BUGs, but do not add new major features or architectural changes. It is currently v3.10.
* Development: The current main development branch. The major new features or architectural changes are developed in the branch. The development branch is always master branch.

## Release Cycles

The minor versions of each branches will be periodically built and released in the format of docker images. The release cycle is as follow:

* Stable: released in the middle of each month
* Mainline: release at the beginning of each month
* Development: never released publicly

A new minor version will be released around half a year. Next to be released minor version is v3.11.

Only major architectual changes will increase the major version number. The  following is the  history of the major versions:
